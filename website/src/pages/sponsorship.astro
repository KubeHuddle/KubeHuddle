      <p>
        KubeHuddle is Scotland’s first Kubernetes conference. While we're hosted and organized by the Scottish community, we have already sold tickets in England, Germany, and Indonesia.
      </p>

      <p>
        A community-run conference, like KubeHuddle, provides better opportunities for collaboration, conversation and connections, giving our audience a more intimate alternative to larger format conferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>KubeHuddle will take place in Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, on October 3rd and 4th.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We anticipate 200 attendees, though more accurate projections will be supplied after the first six weeks of sales. Interest is already high. Within the first four hours of announcing the event, 20 tickets were sold, further selling an additional 30 within our first 48 hours of being listed.

      <p>
        <strong>Note 1</strong>
        <br/>
        Our Malt sponsorship entitles you to name one of our two rooms, from which the sessions will be presented each day. If your organization is called "XYZ”, we'll refer to the room as "XYZ Room”. The choice which room is reserved for the first organization to sponsor at this level.
        <br/>
        <strong>Optional:</strong> If you’d like someone from your organization to MC/host the room, please let us know. We think this could be fun and interesting to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note 2</strong>
        <br/>
        You’ll get one speaker slot for someone from your organization to present. This talk must be technical and not a marketing or sales pitch. We can work with you on the abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note 3</strong>
        <br/>
        You'll get a 10 minute session at the beginning, or end, of one day to talk to our attendees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note 4</strong>
        <br/>
        Sponsor tables are located in the collaboration track, which is configured for cabaret. Attendees will be able to access and work from this space throughout the conference. This is also where breakfast and lunch will be served.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note 5</strong>
        <br/>
        We'll thank you during the opening and closing keynote, you'll have your logo available on the screens between sessions, and we'll tweet our gratitude along with your Twitter handle and/or web link in the run up to the conference, up to 6 times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note 6</strong>
        <br/>
        You can provide two small items (leaflet, sticker, etc) that will be put into the bags given to each attendee

      <p>
        KubeHuddle first started occurred in Edinburgh, Scotland in October 2022. While we're hosted and organized by the Scottish community, we have already sold tickets in England, Germany, and Indonesia.
      </p>

      <p>
        A community-run conference, like KubeHuddle, provides better opportunities for collaboration, conversation and connections, giving our audience a more intimate alternative to larger format conferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>KubeHuddle will happen in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in May 2023 üá®üá¶ </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We anticipate 400 attendees, though more accurate projections will be supplied after the first six weeks of sales.

This also includes a special shoutout tying your organization to the room.

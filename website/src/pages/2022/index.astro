        Our Values
      </h3>

      <p>
        KubeHuddle is a community run conference and we want to ensure that everything we do and say is transparent and made publicly available.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Our task list and what we’re planning is all public on GitHub</li>
        <li>Our sponsorship details are all public</li>
        <li>All titles submitted as potential sessions at KubeHuddle are public on Sessionize</li>
        <li>This website is open source</li>
        <li>Currently KubeHuddle is being run through my (@rawkode) company, but after the first event we’ll migrate this to a non-profit. All financial transactions for KubeHuddle will be made public as soon as I find a nice way to handle that.</li>

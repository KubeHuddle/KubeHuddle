      Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our

    <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or

      contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
      communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

      This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies
      when an individual is officially representing the community in public
      spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official
      e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as
      an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

      investigated promptly and fairly.
